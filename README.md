##The Bezos-Post Conflict-of-Interest Crayon

The Conflict-of-Interest Crayon is a bookmarklet that highlights subjects, companies and people which now pose an actual or potential conflict of interest for reporters at the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post.

For instance, here's what the Conflict-of-Interest crayon found in a *Post* [story]((http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/06/heres-what-amazon-lobbies-for-in-d-c/) about the lobbying activities of Bezos's main company, Amazon:

##How to install it

To install the bookmarklet, follow these instructions. 

TK

After you've installed the bookmarklet, head over to [washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/). 

Now, while viewing any article, section front or even the home page, click on the bookmarklet. 

After a brief delay for processing, the **Bezos-Post Conflict-of-Interest Crayon** should highlight your electronic copy of the *Post* with yellow streaks of skepticism. 

Sometimes a question mark will appear next to your cursor when you hover over a highlight. If that happens, it means you can click on the highlighted word for some additional explanation. Thus:

The bookmarklet will highlight words on any page, even those outside the washingtonpost.com domain, so you can use it to analyze *Post*-managed Twitter pages or *Post* stories in your RSS reader (or auctions on Amazon.com for that matter).

###What gets highlighted?

The words and phrases identified as potential conflicts of interest are listed in a [public wiki, here](https://github.com/coreyp/The-Bezos-Post-Conflict-of-Interest-Crayon/wiki/Running-list-of-potential-ownership-related-conflicts-for-the-Washington-Post).

I came up with the initial list of approximately 440 keywords based on a few hours worth of research on Wikipedia, news websites, NASDAQ, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Sunlight Foundation's wonderful (Influence Explorer)[http://influenceexplorer.com/], which aggregates public records on campaign finance, lobbying, federal regulation and more.

The list so far consists of the following:

*Â people closely related, in one way or another, to Bezos; 
* companies with which Amazon or another Bezos company does business; 
* companies which compete with Amazon or another Bezos company; 
* industries, sectors and product categories which make Amazon and Bezos a significant amount of money; 
* companies and people which have sued or are being sued by Amazon or Bezos; 
* politicians and causes supported or opposed, financially or otherwise, by Bezos or Amazon;
* common sense extrapolations drawn from the above.

Sources are listed in the wiki where possible.

###How to contribute

Please suggest additional conflicts [in the wiki](https://github.com/coreyp/The-Bezos-Post-Conflict-of-Interest-Crayon/wiki/Running-list-of-potential-ownership-related-conflicts-for-the-Washington-Post) or, if you don't have a GitHub account, by [TK, here](LINKTK). 

If I like a suggestion, I'll add it to the script at this repo, which will automatically update the bookmarklet for all users.  

Likewise, if someone makes a convincing argument that something I've included does not pose an actual or potential conflict of interest for Washington Post reporters and editors, I'll remove it from the list.
